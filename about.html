          <p>I'm currently a 5th year senior at 
            Northeastern University in Boston. Having majored in Computer 
            Science and Mathematics, I'm most interested in data science and
            analytics. I love digging into large datasets to discover what 
            sort of insights lie just below the surface. During my time
            at Northeastern, I've gained experience working with Python (and its
            various packages: sklearn, pandas, etc.), Scala, Spark, 
            Jupyter/Zeppelin notebooks and various AWS tools. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I've completed 3 co-op programs in the Boston area, for a total of 18 
            months of real-world work experience. Most recently, 
            I've gained a passion for applying machine learning techniques 
            to the healthcare field: I truly believe that these new 
            technologies can make a difference in patients' quality of care.
            <br>
            <br>
            During my time at Northeastern, I've gained a huge appreciation for
            both learning and mentorship. One of the main tenets of Northeastern's 
            Computer Science Program is how to <i>learn</i> new programming languages.
            Starting off my freshman year with no prior experience, Northeastern was
            able to teach me a lot through their custom language, Racket.
            Since then I've been able to learn new skills through my classes and co-ops.
            I've been fortunate enough to help mentor younger students in many capacities:
            as a tutor, a TA, a "Fellow", and most recently as a founder of a Computer Science
            mentoring student group.   
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of classes and co-ops, I've been very involved on campus, participating in: 
            Student Government as part of the Student Involvement board, 
            <a href="https://alumni.northeastern.edu/communities/current-students/students-today-alumni-tomorrow-stat/" target="_blank">
            Students Today Alumni Tomorrow</a>, 
            <a href="https://sail.northeastern.edu" target="_blank">SAIL</a> advisory board, and 
            <a href="http://www.huskyambassadors.org/" target="_blank">Husky Ambassadors</a>.
            In my free time I like to <a href="paintings.html" target="_blank">paint</a>, 
            <a href="food.html" target="_blank">cook</a>,
            and play board games.
